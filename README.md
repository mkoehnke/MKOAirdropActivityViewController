# MKOAirdropActivityViewController
This is basically a **view hierarchy hack** of the UIActivityViewController to hide the sharing sections below the Airdrop field. With the introduction of sharing extensions in iOS8 it is currently not possible to hide those sections using the **excludedActivityTypes** property anymore.

I currently use it in a side project as an intermediate solution. It was tested with iOS9. 

**Note:** This hack doesn't use any private API. But the view structure of UIActivityViewController might change with any future release, so it is **not recommended** to use this in production.
